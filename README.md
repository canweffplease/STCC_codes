# Standard Transportation Commodity Code

I manually matched STCC codes to the commodity names. It took a long time to do and I don't want anyone else to go through this again. Feel free to use this json in any use case. I would appreciate credit but it isn't required. :) 

Link to where I got it from (pages 116 to 167):
